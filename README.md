- Create New URL functionality redirects to http://localhost:8080/urls/new page with a text field "Enter a URL" and text box for entering it and submit button. After submission long URL is converted into short URL and displays both. There is also an option to edit the long URL on the page.

- After registration the page checks the credentials upon logging in. If user name matches password, user logs in otherwise shows "password is wrong" for incorrect password (login page) or "Username already exists" (Register page).
